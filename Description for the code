This is the code for the simulation results in the paper "A multi-level Monte Carlo simulation for invariant distribution of  Markovian switching Levy-driven SDEs with super-linearly growth coefficients" (see https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.04081 for more details)
For the solution approximation, we calculated the discretized value of the tamed-adaptive E-M scheme to approximate the solution of the Levy-driven SDEwMS, which was presented quite clearly in our paper. To see the convergence rate, we use the Monte-Carlo method to approximate the Expectation value of the error. This idea is shown through the function MSE that we mentioned in Subsection 4 of the paper.
For the invariant distribution approximation, we draw the box-plots that represent the dispersion of the values of \widehat{Y} for three different cases of the function \phi (as in Subsection 5.2).
Assume that for a length of estimation interval $T_0$, number of levels $L_0$, and $(N^0_l)_{1 \leq l \leq L}$ samples for each level $l$, the approximation algorithm can attain an accuracy level $\varepsilon_0$. From this, we can choose the corresponding estimation interval, number of levels, and number of samples for each level $l$ so that the accuracy level can be attained at $\varepsilon_0$, $\varepsilon_0/2$, $\varepsilon_0/4$, $\varepsilon_0/8$, and $\varepsilon_0/16$. For these accuracy levels, we generate respectively $32$, $16$, $8$, $4$, and $2$ samples for $\widehat{Y}$ and compute the sample variances. At this point, we once again use the regression method to see the relation between $\log_2 \text{Var}(\widehat{Y}) $ and $\log_2 \varepsilon$.
